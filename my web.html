<h1><u><b>Things have been realy tough since i got my first job.</b></u></h1>

<p>i got my first job when i was about <i>[25 years old]</i>.</p>

<p>I've always told myself that thinks are going to be ok but still i aint seing anything
changing apart of the undeciplined teenagers doing drug abuse and the robots still planning
to take over the planet.</p>

<h2><u>Time travel</u></h2>

<p>lets get back to 1996 when i was 17 years old.My folks left me alone, they told me that they where
going to buy some milk.<b>30;40;50 and an hour passed </b>still looking forward to their arrival 
to see that they left me alone in that crappy trailer you call a house</p>
